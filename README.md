# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Leaf Disease Detection

This project uses image classification techniques to detect diseases in rice plant leaves. It applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify disease types from images, aiding in early diagnosis and better crop management.

##  Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based deep learning model
- Classification of healthy vs. diseased leaves
- Visualization of predictions and evaluation metrics

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib

##  Files Included
- `PRCP- 1001- RiceLeaf disease detection.ipynb` â€“ Main Jupyter notebook
- Image dataset (if applicable)
- Sample prediction outputs

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RiceLeaf-Disease-Detection.git
   
2.Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the notebook:jupyter notebook PRCP-\ 1001-\ RiceLeaf\ disease\ detection.ipynb

 ### Results
The model achieved high accuracy in classifying leaf images.
Confusion matrix and plots included for evaluation.
